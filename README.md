# temp

A simple program to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius or vice versa.

This is currently just a command line toy, and isn't built for use by programs.

## Usage

Enter the temperature you want to convert as a number followed by the character 'c' / 'C' or 'f' / 'F', no spaces:

`./temp 69.0F`

or

`./temp -12.3c`

The decimal is not needed:

`./temp 21f`
